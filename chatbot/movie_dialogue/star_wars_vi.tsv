L467152	u7247	m489	LANDO	We're on our way. Red Group Gold Group all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
L467151	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
L467109	u7247	m489	LANDO	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
L467108	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	At that close range we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
L467101	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
L467100	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We have no choice General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
L467099	u7247	m489	LANDO	You won't get another chance at this Admiral.
L467098	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
L467022	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right. Stand by.
L467021	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	All craft prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
L467019	u7241	m489	ACKBAR	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
L467018	u7247	m489	LANDO	Admiral we're in position. All fighters accounted for.
L466818	u7242	m489	BEN	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have Luke... but the Force is strong with her as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
L466817	u7249	m489	LUKE	But you can't let her get involved now Ben. Vader will destroy her.
L466816	u7242	m489	BEN	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
L466815	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia! Leia's my sister.
L466814	u7242	m489	BEN	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew as I did if Anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
L466813	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I have no sister.
L466812	u7242	m489	BEN	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
L466811	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda spoke of another.
L466810	u7242	m489	BEN	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
L466809	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't kill my own father.
L466808	u7242	m489	BEN	To be a Jedi Luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you like your father. Only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now Luke. You are strong and patient. And now you must face Darth Vader again!
L466807	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I had to help my friends.
L466806	u7242	m489	BEN	Vader humbled you when first you met him Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you among other things the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
L466805	u7249	m489	LUKE	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
L466804	u7242	m489	BEN	You cannot escape your destiny.
L466803	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it Ben.
L466802	u7242	m489	BEN	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
L466801	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's still good in him.
L466796	u7242	m489	BEN	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
L466795	u7249	m489	LUKE	You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
L466793	u7242	m489	BEN	Yoda will always be with you.
L466792	u7249	m489	LUKE	I can't do it Artoo. I can't go on alone.
L466672	u7245	m489	HAN	Who are you?
L466671	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Jabba's palace.
L466670	u7245	m489	HAN	Where am I?
L466669	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Your eyesight will return in time.
L466668	u7245	m489	HAN	I can't see.
L466667	u7243	m489	BOUSHH	Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
L467037	u7252	m489	VADER	His lightsaber.
L467036	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Oh no my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
L466915	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
L466914	u7252	m489	VADER	They are clear my Master.
L466913	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear Lord Vader.
L466912	u7252	m489	VADER	I have felt him my Master.
L466911	u7252	m489	VADER	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
L466910	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	I told you to remain on the command ship.
L466857	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes my Master.
L466856	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
L466855	u7252	m489	VADER	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
L466854	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.
L466853	u7252	m489	VADER	What is thy bidding my Master?
L466772	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
L466771	u7252	m489	VADER	As you wish.
L466770	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	Patience my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
L466769	u7252	m489	VADER	Yes my Master.
L466768	u7244	m489	EMPEROR	You have done well Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
L466767	u7252	m489	VADER	The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
L466950	u7249	m489	LUKE	Threepio tell them if they don't do as you wish you'll become angry and use your magic.
L466949	u7245	m489	HAN	Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
L466930	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han don't. It'll be all right.
L466929	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey!
L466926	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah sure.
L466925	u7249	m489	LUKE	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han can you reach my lightsaber?
L466924	u7245	m489	HAN	Nice work. Great Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.
L466893	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come on Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
L466892	u7245	m489	HAN	Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
L466890	u7249	m489	LUKE	We got separated.
L466889	u7245	m489	HAN	I thought she was with you.
L466879	u7249	m489	LUKE	Quietly there might be more of them out there.
L466878	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
L466867	u7245	m489	HAN	It's your imagination kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
L466866	u7249	m489	LUKE	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
L466865	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know.  Fly casual.
L466864	u7245	m489	HAN	Now don't get jittery Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though Chewie but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
L466863	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader's on that ship.
L466850	u7249	m489	LUKE	All set.
L466849	u7245	m489	HAN	Right. Chewie let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready everybody?
L466845	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yeah she's comin' up.
L466844	u7245	m489	HAN	You got her warmed?
L466837	u7249	m489	LUKE	Hi Han... Chewie.
L466836	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke.
L466759	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
L466758	u7245	m489	HAN	Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
L466721	u7245	m489	HAN	Oh... great!
L466720	u7249	m489	LUKE	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
L466719	u7245	m489	HAN	You're gonna die here you know. Convenient.
L466718	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's nothing to see. I used to live here you know.
L466717	u7245	m489	HAN	I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur I see a big light blur.
L466709	u7245	m489	HAN	That bad huh? Where's Leia?
L466708	u7249	m489	LUKE	The same as always.
L466707	u7245	m489	HAN	How are we doing?
L466706	u7249	m489	LUKE	Wouldn't miss it.
L466705	u7245	m489	HAN	Fine. Together again huh?
L466704	u7249	m489	LUKE	Are you all right?
L466703	u7245	m489	HAN	Luke!
L466702	u7249	m489	LUKE	Han!
L467183	u7245	m489	HAN	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back I won't get in the way.
L467182	u7248	m489	LEIA	Yes.
L467181	u7245	m489	HAN	You love him don't you?
L467180	u7248	m489	LEIA	He wasn't. I can feel it.
L467179	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
L467081	u7245	m489	HAN	Here's the terminal.
L467080	u7248	m489	LEIA	The code's changed. We need Artoo!
L467048	u7245	m489	HAN	Charges!  Come on come on!
L467047	u7248	m489	LEIA	Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
L467015	u7245	m489	HAN	Hey don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
L467014	u7248	m489	LEIA	The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
L466995	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hold me.
L466994	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm sorry.
L466993	u7245	m489	HAN	Ahhh...
L466992	u7248	m489	LEIA	I...
L466960	u7248	m489	LEIA	I don't know.
L466959	u7245	m489	HAN	What's going on?
L466877	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
L466876	u7248	m489	LEIA	Shall we try and go around?
L466862	u7245	m489	HAN	It'll work. It'll work.
L466861	u7248	m489	LEIA	Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
L466848	u7245	m489	HAN	Yeah I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
L466847	u7248	m489	LEIA	Hey are you awake?
L466756	u7248	m489	LEIA	That's all any of us can see.
L466755	u7245	m489	HAN	I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
L466675	u7248	m489	LEIA	I gotta get you out of here.
L466674	u7245	m489	HAN	Leia!
L466673	u7248	m489	LEIA	Someone who loves you.
L466843	u7245	m489	HAN	You too.
L466842	u7247	m489	LANDO	Good luck.
L466840	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right old buddy. You know I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
L466839	u7245	m489	HAN	Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
L466820	u7247	m489	LANDO	Oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
L466819	u7245	m489	HAN	Well look at you a general huh?
L466761	u7247	m489	LANDO	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
L466760	u7245	m489	HAN	Guess I owe you some thanks too Lando.
L466746	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
L466745	u7245	m489	HAN	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
L466744	u7247	m489	LANDO	No wait! I thought you were blind!
L466743	u7245	m489	HAN	Chewie! Chewie give me the gun. Don't move Lando.
L466737	u7245	m489	HAN	I'm trying!
L466736	u7247	m489	LANDO	Lower it!
L466735	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando grab it!
L466733	u7245	m489	HAN	Lando!
L466732	u7247	m489	LANDO	Han! Chewie?
L467118	u7245	m489	HAN	Let's see.
L467117	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh Princess Leia are you all right?
L467106	u7245	m489	HAN	Well I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
L467105	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	My goodness! Artoo why did you have to be so brave?
L467104	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh Artoo hurry!
L467103	u7245	m489	HAN	Come on! Come on!
L467102	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	We're coming!
L466945	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm rather embarrassed General Solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
L466944	u7245	m489	HAN	What did he say?
L466940	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
L466939	u7245	m489	HAN	Proper?!
L466938	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I beg your pardon General Solo but that just wouldn't be proper.
L466937	u7245	m489	HAN	Well why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
L466936	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Hello I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
L466935	u7245	m489	HAN	What are you telling them?
L466852	u7245	m489	HAN	All right hang on.
L466851	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Here we go again.
L466715	u7245	m489	HAN	On second thought let's pass on that huh?
L466714	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
L466713	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
L466712	u7245	m489	HAN	Good I hate long waits.
L466711	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh dear. His High Exaltedness the great Jabba the Hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
L466619	u7252	m489	VADER	I hope so Commander for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
L466618	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	We shall double our efforts.
L466617	u7252	m489	VADER	That is correct Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
L466616	u7252	m489	VADER	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
L466615	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
L466614	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
L466613	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I tell you this station will be operational as planned.
L466612	u7252	m489	VADER	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
L466611	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	I assure you Lord Vader my men are working as fast as they can.
L466610	u7252	m489	VADER	You may dispense with the pleasantries Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
L466609	u7246	m489	JERJERROD	Lord Vader this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
L467176	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Copy Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
L467175	u7247	m489	LANDO	All right Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
L467174	u7253	m489	WEDGE	There it is!
L467160	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
L467159	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
L467158	u7247	m489	LANDO	Here goes nothing.
L467157	u7253	m489	WEDGE	I'm going in.
L467137	u7247	m489	LANDO	Now...come on Han old buddy. Don't let me down.
L467136	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Good shot Red Two.
L467052	u7253	m489	WEDGE	Red Leader standing by.
L467051	u7247	m489	LANDO	All wings report in.
L467028	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh no.
L467027	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
L467026	u7248	m489	LEIA	Quiet.
L467025	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh! Oh my. Uh Princess Leia!
L467017	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
L467016	u7248	m489	LEIA	What's he saying?
L466947	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Your Royal Highness.
L466946	u7248	m489	LEIA	Oh!
L466682	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Ohhh I can't bear to watch.
L466681	u7248	m489	LEIA	Ugh!
L466988	u7249	m489	LUKE	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
L466987	u7248	m489	LEIA	But why must you confront him?
L466986	u7249	m489	LUKE	No you don't. You've always been strong.
L466985	u7248	m489	LEIA	No! Luke run away far away. If he can feel your presence then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
L466984	u7249	m489	LUKE	Then you know why I have to face him.
L466983	u7248	m489	LEIA	I know. Somehow...I've always known.
L466982	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes. It's you Leia.
L466981	u7249	m489	LUKE	You're wrong Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
L466980	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
L466979	u7249	m489	LUKE	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it but you must. If I don't make it back you're the only hope for the Alliance.
L466978	u7248	m489	LEIA	Your father?
L466977	u7249	m489	LUKE	He's my father.
L466974	u7249	m489	LUKE	Vader is here...now on this moon.
L466973	u7248	m489	LEIA	Luke tell me. What's troubling you?
L466972	u7249	m489	LUKE	I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
L466971	u7248	m489	LEIA	She was very beautiful. Kind but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
L466970	u7249	m489	LUKE	Tell me.
L466969	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just...images really. Feelings.
L466968	u7249	m489	LUKE	What do you remember?
L466967	u7248	m489	LEIA	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
L466966	u7249	m489	LUKE	Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
L466882	u7249	m489	LUKE	I see them. Wait Leia!
L466881	u7248	m489	LEIA	Over there! Two more of them!
L467146	u7249	m489	LUKE	Never-r-r!
L467145	u7252	m489	VADER	Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will.
L467144	u7252	m489	VADER	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
L467143	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you.
L467142	u7252	m489	VADER	You cannot hide forever Luke.
L467133	u7252	m489	VADER	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight then you will meet your destiny.
L467132	u7249	m489	LUKE	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
L467131	u7252	m489	VADER	There is no conflict.
L467130	u7249	m489	LUKE	Your thoughts betray you father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
L467128	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not fight you father.
L467127	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan has taught you well.
L467012	u7252	m489	VADER	It is too late for me son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
L467011	u7249	m489	LUKE	Search your feelings father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
L467010	u7252	m489	VADER	If that is your destiny.
L467009	u7249	m489	LUKE	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
L467008	u7252	m489	VADER	You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
L467007	u7252	m489	VADER	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
L467006	u7249	m489	LUKE	Come with me.
L467002	u7252	m489	VADER	So you have accepted the truth.
L467001	u7249	m489	LUKE	I know father.
L467000	u7252	m489	VADER	The Emperor has been expecting you.
L466790	u7254	m489	YODA	Remember a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger fear aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.
L466789	u7249	m489	LUKE	Well I'm sorry.
L466788	u7249	m489	LUKE	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
L466787	u7254	m489	YODA	Unexpected this is and unfortunate...
L466786	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yes.
L466785	u7254	m489	YODA	Told you did he?
L466784	u7254	m489	YODA	Your father he is.
L466783	u7249	m489	LUKE	Yoda I must know.
L466779	u7254	m489	YODA	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
L466778	u7249	m489	LUKE	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
L466777	u7254	m489	YODA	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
L466776	u7249	m489	LUKE	Master Yoda you can't die.
L466653	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Disintegrated?
L466652	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
L466651	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily...
L466650	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	How many languages do you speak?
L466649	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	Oh. Well yes.
L466648	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Yes or no will do.
L466647	u7251	m489	THREEPIO	I am See-Threepio human-cy...
L466646	u7250	m489	NINEDENINE	Ah good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid are you not?
