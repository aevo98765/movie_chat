L373507	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Know what?
L373506	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	You don't know.
L373444	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
L373443	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	They are dead.  In either case --
L372816	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	It's already begun.
L372815	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	We'll need a search running.
L372814	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Their next target.  The name is Neo.
L372813	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
L372812	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	He'll be contacting us again.
L372811	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
L372810	u6516	m433	AGENT JONES	Then the informant is real.
L373358	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You all look the same to me.
L373357	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
L373356	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	And you are?
L373355	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
L373350	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	They won't make it.
L373349	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hurry!
L373348	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The sewers.  Of course.
L372797	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	No Lieutenant your men are already dead.
L372796	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
L372794	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	The orders were for your protection.
L372793	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
L372792	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant you were given specific orders --
L372791	u6521	m433	LIEUTENANT	Oh shit.
L372790	u6517	m433	AGENT SMITH	Lieutenant?
L373397	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Oh God.
L373396	u6518	m433	APOC	What?!
L373310	u6518	m433	APOC	Should Tank I.D. it?
L373309	u6525	m433	SWITCH	That's the third white van I've seen.
L373308	u6518	m433	APOC	What?
L373307	u6525	m433	SWITCH	Weird.
L373109	u6518	m433	APOC	No way.  Not possible.
L373108	u6525	m433	SWITCH	He's gonna make it.
L372833	u6519	m433	CHOI	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
L372832	u6523	m433	NEO	You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
L372831	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know... My computer...
L372830	u6519	m433	CHOI	Something wrong man?  You look a little whiter than usual.
L372829	u6523	m433	NEO	Right...
L372828	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
L372827	u6523	m433	NEO	If you get caught using that --
L372826	u6519	m433	CHOI	Hallelujah!  You are my savior man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
L372824	u6519	m433	CHOI	Two grand.
L372823	u6523	m433	NEO	You got the money?
L372822	u6519	m433	CHOI	I know.  It's her fault.
L372821	u6523	m433	NEO	You're two hours late.
L372820	u6519	m433	CHOI	It's Choi.
L372819	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is it?
L373413	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No!
L373412	u6527	m433	TRINITY	... yes.
L373408	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Don't hate me Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
L373407	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamn you Cypher!
L373405	u6520	m433	CYPHER	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
L373404	u6527	m433	TRINITY	But you're out Cypher.  You can't go back.
L373402	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Oh I disagree Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean all I do is pull a plug here.  But there you watch a man die.
L373401	u6527	m433	TRINITY	The Matrix isn't real!
L373400	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yes.  You see the truth is Trinity that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
L373399	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
L373398	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm tired Trinity.  I'm tired of this war I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship of being cold of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
L373395	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You killed them.
L373394	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
L373392	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An accident?!
L373391	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He had an accident.
L373390	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher?  Where's Tank?
L373389	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hello Trinity.
L373128	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
L373127	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
L373126	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't tell me you're a believer now?
L373125	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There's something about him isn't there?
L372786	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Yeah 'course I'm sure.
L372785	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you sure this line is clean?
L372784	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Hear what?
L372783	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Did you hear that?
L372782	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I intend to believe me.  Someone has to.
L372781	u6527	m433	TRINITY	If you have something to say I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
L372780	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You don't do you?
L372779	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
L372778	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Do you?
L372777	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus believes he is the One.
L372776	u6520	m433	CYPHER	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
L372775	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Don't be ridiculous.
L372773	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
L372772	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You weren't supposed to relieve me.
L373187	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Any time.
L373186	u6523	m433	NEO	Thanks... for the drink.
L373184	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
L373183	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373182	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Dead.  All dead.
L373181	u6523	m433	NEO	What happened to them?
L373180	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Five.  Since I've been here.
L373179	u6523	m433	NEO	How many were there?
L373178	u6520	m433	CYPHER	You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
L373177	u6523	m433	NEO	Really?
L373176	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
L373175	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
L373174	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yeah.
L373173	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Why you're here?
L373168	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde brunette and redhead.  You want a drink?
L373167	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you always look at it encoded?
L373166	u6520	m433	CYPHER	The Matrix?  Yeah.
L373165	u6523	m433	NEO	Is that...?
L373164	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Midnight watch.
L373163	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373162	u6520	m433	CYPHER	No it's all right.
L373161	u6523	m433	NEO	Sorry.
L373160	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Whoa!  Shit Neo you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
L373057	u6520	m433	CYPHER	He's going to pop!
L373056	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
L373370	u6526	m433	TANK	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
L373369	u6520	m433	CYPHER	Just get me outta here.
L373368	u6526	m433	TANK	I got you.
L373367	u6520	m433	CYPHER	There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus someone's going to make a believer out of me.
L373366	u6526	m433	TANK	Cypher?
L373365	u6520	m433	CYPHER	I need an exit!  Fast!
L373364	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373589	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
L373588	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't use that until Neo is out!
L373585	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
L373584	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How long?
L373569	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He's beginning to believe.
L373568	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What is he doing?
L373333	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have no choice.
L373332	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They'll be able to track it.
L373331	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Give me your phone.
L373007	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What if he isn't the One Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
L373006	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We found him Trinity.  We finally found him.
L373000	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Shit!  Apoc?
L372999	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I got a fibrillation!
L372807	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go.
L372806	u6527	m433	TRINITY	All right --
L372805	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
L372804	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!
L372803	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372802	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are they any agent?
L372801	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
L373544	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later Neo you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
L373543	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus the Oracle... she told me --
L373347	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
L373346	u6523	m433	NEO	No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
L373250	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please Neo I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
L373249	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus I don't know --
L373248	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Listen to me Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
L373245	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One not that he would find me.
L373244	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you believe in them too?
L373243	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
L373242	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes I do.
L373241	u6523	m433	NEO	And you still believe I'm the One?
L373240	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
L373239	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody I'm just a guy.  What did I do Morpheus?  Why me?
L373238	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That's why we're here.
L373237	u6523	m433	NEO	What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real wasn't.  The whole world my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore Morpheus.
L373236	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What do you believe in?
L373235	u6523	m433	NEO	I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it so what's the point?
L373234	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why?
L373233	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus I don't think this is a good idea.
L373231	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That I would find the One.
L373230	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373229	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L373228	u6523	m433	NEO	She helped you?
L373227	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide Neo. She can help you find the path.
L373226	u6523	m433	NEO	And she's never wrong.
L373225	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past present or future.  There is only what is.
L373224	u6523	m433	NEO	How does she know?
L373223	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	She would say she knows enough.
L373222	u6523	m433	NEO	And she knows what?  Everything?
L373221	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Of the Resistance.
L373220	u6523	m433	NEO	The beginning?
L373219	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
L373218	u6523	m433	NEO	So is this the same oracle that made the uh prophecy?
L373149	u6523	m433	NEO	What's going on?
L373148	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Set down in there.
L373144	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready you won't have to.
L373143	u6523	m433	NEO	What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
L373142	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
L373141	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373140	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
L373137	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Look again.
L373136	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373135	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
L373134	u6523	m433	NEO	I think I do.
L373133	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you understand Neo?
L373130	u6523	m433	NEO	What -- what lesson?
L373129	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
L373122	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The body cannot live without the mind.
L373121	u6523	m433	NEO	If you are killed in the Matrix you die here?
L373120	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your mind makes it real.
L373119	u6523	m433	NEO	I thought it wasn't real.
L373115	u6523	m433	NEO	Because... I didn't think I would?
L373114	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you know why you didn't make it?
L373104	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm trying to free your mind Neo but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank load the jump program.
L373103	u6523	m433	NEO	I know what you're trying to do --
L373096	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
L373095	u6523	m433	NEO	You -- you're too fast.
L373094	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How did I beat you?
L373089	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Show me.
L373088	u6523	m433	NEO	This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
L373066	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your training.
L373065	u6523	m433	NEO	For what?
L373064	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
L373051	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I didn't say that it would be easy Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
L373050	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
L373042	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
L373041	u6523	m433	NEO	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
L373040	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that at some point in the early Twenty-first Century all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
L373035	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
L373034	u6523	m433	NEO	This isn't real?
L373033	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Wild isn't it?
L373032	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now we're inside a computer program?
L373020	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
L373019	u6523	m433	NEO	When?
L373018	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	More important than what is when?
L373017	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus what's happened to me? What is this place?
L373015	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You've never used them before.
L373014	u6523	m433	NEO	Why do my eyes hurt?
L373013	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
L373012	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373009	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Far from it.
L373008	u6523	m433	NEO	... am I dead?
L372990	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Be what?  Be real?
L372989	u6523	m433	NEO	This can't be...
L372988	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Have you ever had a dream Neo that you were so sure was real?
L372985	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L372984	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
L372974	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	That you are a slave Neo.  Like everyone else you were born into bondage kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch. A prison for your mind.
L372973	u6523	m433	NEO	What truth?
L372972	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The Matrix is everywhere it's all around us here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
L372971	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you want to know what it is?
L372970	u6523	m433	NEO	The Matrix?
L372969	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what but it's there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L372968	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I know exactly what you mean.
L372967	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
L372966	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Why not?
L372965	u6523	m433	NEO	No.
L372964	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate Neo?
L372963	u6523	m433	NEO	You're Morpheus you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
L372962	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Ironically this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me Neo why are you here?
L372961	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
L372960	u6523	m433	NEO	You could say that.
L372959	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole?
L372957	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Please.  Come.  Sit.
L372956	u6523	m433	NEO	It's an honor.
L372955	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Welcome Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed I am Morpheus.
L372929	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go the the Adams Street bridge.
L372928	u6523	m433	NEO	... Yes.
L372927	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do you still want to meet?
L372926	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	You're the One Neo.  You see you may have spent the last few years looking for me but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
L372925	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you know?
L372924	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	They got to you first but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know you would probably be dead.
L372923	u6523	m433	NEO	The agents --
L372922	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	This line is tapped so I must be brief.
L372902	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
L372901	u6523	m433	NEO	No way no way this is crazy.
L372900	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
L372899	u6523	m433	NEO	No!  It's too far away.
L372896	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know all this?
L372895	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
L372890	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Go!  Now!
L372889	u6523	m433	NEO	But what if...?
L372888	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	The cubicle across from you is empty.
L372887	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I can guide you out but you have to do exactly what I say.
L372886	u6523	m433	NEO	How?!
L372885	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I'm not sure but if you don't want to find out you better get out of there.
L372884	u6523	m433	NEO	What the fuck do they want with me?!
L372883	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.
L372882	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy fucking shit!
L372880	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Yes.  Now.
L372879	u6523	m433	NEO	Right now?
L372878	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Stand up and see for yourself.
L372877	u6523	m433	NEO	Who's coming for me?
L372876	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I've been looking for you Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you but unfortunately we have run out of time.  They're coming for you Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
L372875	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus...
L372874	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Hello Neo.  Do you know who this is?
L372873	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373630	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	He is the One.  He is the One!
L373629	u6526	m433	TANK	How...?!
L373615	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Do it!
L373614	u6526	m433	TANK	I'm going to make the call.
L373587	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes sir.
L373586	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank charge the E.M.P.
L373549	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We're on our way --
L373548	u6526	m433	TANK	Got one ready sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
L373547	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	We need an exit.
L373546	u6526	m433	TANK	Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice sir!
L373545	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Tank.
L373338	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	Good.
L373337	u6526	m433	TANK	Now left and that's it in front of you.
L373336	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	I need the main wet-wall.
L373335	u6526	m433	TANK	Got it.
L373087	u6526	m433	TANK	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
L373086	u6522	m433	MORPHEUS	How is he?
L373299	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one will be up to you.
L373298	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373297	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Morpheus believes in you Neo and no one not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
L373295	u6523	m433	NEO	What do you mean without him?
L373294	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
L373293	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
L373292	u6524	m433	ORACLE	What's funny?
L373291	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Your next life maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
L373290	u6523	m433	NEO	What?
L373289	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Sorry kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
L373288	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One.
L373287	u6524	m433	ORACLE	But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
L373286	u6523	m433	NEO	But what?
L373285	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Okay now I'm supposed to say 'Hmmm that's interesting but...' Then you say --
L373281	u6523	m433	NEO	Honestly?  I don't know.
L373280	u6524	m433	ORACLE	So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
L373278	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Not too bright though.
L373277	u6523	m433	NEO	Who?
L373276	u6524	m433	ORACLE	You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
L373274	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you know...?
L373273	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
L373272	u6523	m433	NEO	Shit I'm sorry.
L373271	u6524	m433	ORACLE	That vase.
L373270	u6523	m433	NEO	What vase?
L373269	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I'd ask you to sit down but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
L373268	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah.
L373267	u6524	m433	ORACLE	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good don't they?
L373266	u6523	m433	NEO	You're the Oracle?
L373265	u6524	m433	ORACLE	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
L373264	u6523	m433	NEO	Hello?
L373525	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Not yet.
L373524	u6523	m433	NEO	Can you fly that thing.
L373523	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm fine.  Come on we have to keep moving.
L373522	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373521	u6523	m433	NEO	It wasn't fast enough.
L373520	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
L373519	u6523	m433	NEO	Do what?
L373518	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo how did you do that?
L373490	u6523	m433	NEO	Yeah?
L373489	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No one has ever done anything like this.
L373481	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell because you aren't going anywhere else.
L373480	u6523	m433	NEO	No you're not.
L373479	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I'm coming with you.
L373478	u6523	m433	NEO	What are you doing?
L373477	u6523	m433	NEO	I believe I can bring him back.
L373476	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373471	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because...
L373470	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L373469	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
L373468	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm sorry I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
L373467	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No you... have to be.
L373466	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm not the One Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
L373465	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373464	u6523	m433	NEO	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
L373463	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
L373462	u6523	m433	NEO	I have to.
L373461	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You can't!
L373460	u6523	m433	NEO	I'm going in after him.
L373459	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What are you doing?
L373458	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What choice?
L373457	u6523	m433	NEO	That I would have to make a choice...
L373446	u6523	m433	NEO	There has to be something that we can do.
L373445	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
L373388	u6523	m433	NEO	I don't know.  It just went dead.
L373387	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?
L373374	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Is Morpheus still alive Tank?
L373373	u6523	m433	NEO	Is Morpheus alive?
L373353	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We have to!
L373352	u6523	m433	NEO	We can't leave him!
L373351	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Go!
L373324	u6527	m433	TRINITY	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
L373323	u6523	m433	NEO	What is it?
L373322	u6523	m433	NEO	It might have been.  I'm not sure.
L373321	u6527	m433	TRINITY	How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
L373320	u6523	m433	NEO	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
L373319	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What happened?  What did you see?
L373318	u6523	m433	NEO	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
L373317	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What did you just say?
L373306	u6523	m433	NEO	... right as rain.
L373305	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you all right?
L373214	u6527	m433	TRINITY	She told me...
L373213	u6523	m433	NEO	What did she tell you?
L373212	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Yes.
L373211	u6523	m433	NEO	Did you go to her?
L373210	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.
L373209	u6523	m433	NEO	Should I be?
L373208	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Are you worried?
L373207	u6523	m433	NEO	Is it?
L373206	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That's different.
L373205	u6523	m433	NEO	But an Oracle can.
L373204	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
L373203	u6523	m433	NEO	What does that mean?
L373201	u6523	m433	NEO	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
L373200	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L373199	u6523	m433	NEO	God...
L373158	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
L373157	u6523	m433	NEO	E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
L373054	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Easy Neo.  Easy.
L373053	u6523	m433	NEO	Get this thing out of me!
L372993	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's going into replication.
L372992	u6523	m433	NEO	Uh-oh...
L372948	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
L372947	u6523	m433	NEO	What is this thing?
L372945	u6523	m433	NEO	... shit.
L372944	u6527	m433	TRINITY	And I know that's not where you want to be.
L372943	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Because you've been down there Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
L372942	u6523	m433	NEO	Why?
L372941	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo please you have to trust me.
L372934	u6527	m433	TRINITY	From you.
L372933	u6523	m433	NEO	From what?
L372932	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's necessary Neo.  For our protection.
L372931	u6523	m433	NEO	What the hell is this?!
L372862	u6527	m433	TRINITY	When I asked him he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
L372861	u6523	m433	NEO	What is the Matrix?
L372860	u6527	m433	TRINITY	It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
L372858	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
L372857	u6523	m433	NEO	Who is?
L372856	u6527	m433	TRINITY	They're watching you Neo.
L372855	u6523	m433	NEO	Of what?
L372854	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Right now all I can tell you is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
L372853	u6523	m433	NEO	How did you do that?
L372851	u6527	m433	TRINITY	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
L372850	u6523	m433	NEO	Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
L372849	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Most guys do.
L372848	u6523	m433	NEO	I just thought... you were a guy.
L372847	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What?
L372846	u6523	m433	NEO	Gee-zus.
L372845	u6527	m433	TRINITY	That was a long time ago.
L372844	u6523	m433	NEO	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
L372843	u6527	m433	TRINITY	My name is Trinity.
L372842	u6523	m433	NEO	Who are you?
L372841	u6527	m433	TRINITY	I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
L372840	u6523	m433	NEO	How do you know that name?
L372839	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hello Neo.
L373606	u6526	m433	TANK	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
L373605	u6523	m433	NEO	It's locked.
L373598	u6526	m433	TANK	Duck!
L373597	u6523	m433	NEO	Which way?  Which way?
L373592	u6523	m433	NEO	Mr. Wizard get me the fuck out of here!
L373591	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373488	u6523	m433	NEO	Guns.  Lots of guns.
L373487	u6526	m433	TANK	Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
L373475	u6523	m433	NEO	Because I believe in something.
L373474	u6526	m433	TANK	Why?
L373473	u6523	m433	NEO	I know that's what it looks like but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
L373472	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back too but what you are talking about is suicide.
L373456	u6523	m433	NEO	The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
L373455	u6526	m433	TANK	What are you talking about?
L373454	u6523	m433	NEO	Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
L373453	u6526	m433	TANK	Neo this has to be done!
L373452	u6523	m433	NEO	Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
L373439	u6526	m433	TANK	Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
L373438	u6523	m433	NEO	What do they want?
L373437	u6526	m433	TANK	When it does Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
L373436	u6526	m433	TANK	Depends on the mind.  But eventually it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
L373435	u6523	m433	NEO	How much time?
L373434	u6526	m433	TANK	They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
L373433	u6523	m433	NEO	How?
L373432	u6526	m433	TANK	They're hacking his mind.
L373431	u6523	m433	NEO	What are they doing to him?
L373196	u6526	m433	TANK	The Oracle.

L373083	u6523	m433	NEO	Holy shit!
L373077	u6526	m433	TANK	Deep underground.  Near the earth's core where it's still warm.  You live long enough you might even see it.
L373076	u6523	m433	NEO	Where is it?
L373075	u6526	m433	TANK	The last human city.  The only place we got left.
L373074	u6523	m433	NEO	It's a city?
L373073	u6526	m433	TANK	If this war ended tomorrow Zion is where the party would be.
L373072	u6523	m433	NEO	Zion?
L373071	u6526	m433	TANK	Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer we are 100 percent pure old- fashioned home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
L373070	u6523	m433	NEO	You don't have...

L373067	u6526	m433	TANK	Morning.  Did you sleep?
L373620	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Hurry Neo.
L373619	u6526	m433	TANK	They've burned through the outer shields.
L373580	u6526	m433	TANK	I don't know.  I lost him.
L373579	u6527	m433	TRINITY	What just happened?
L373565	u6526	m433	TANK	I can't!
L373564	u6527	m433	TRINITY	An Agent!  You have to send me back!
L373563	u6526	m433	TANK	What the hell just happened?
L373562	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Neo!
L373527	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
L373526	u6526	m433	TANK	Operator.
L373449	u6526	m433	TANK	Trinity we don't have any other choice.
L373448	u6527	m433	TRINITY	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
L373447	u6526	m433	TANK	There is.  We have to pull the plug.
L373419	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Dozer?

L373381	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Got it.
L373380	u6526	m433	TANK	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
L373379	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Cypher I thought --
L373378	u6526	m433	TANK	You're not far from Cypher.
L373377	u6527	m433	TRINITY	We need an exit!
L373376	u6527	m433	TRINITY	He's alive.
L373375	u6526	m433	TANK	Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
L373372	u6527	m433	TRINITY	Tank it's me.
