L472143	u7296	m493	ABRAHAM	Boo! Ah ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
L472547	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Tempt not a desperate man!
L472546	u7297	m493	BALTHASAR	Then I'll leave thee.
L472545	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
L472533	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Tush thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
L472532	u7297	m493	BALTHASAR	Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
L472531	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Leave Me!
L472530	u7297	m493	BALTHASAR	Have patience!
L472529	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Then I defy you stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
L472528	u7297	m493	BALTHASAR	If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
L472409	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure I.
L472408	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Either withdraw unto some private place or reason coldly of your grievences or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
L472401	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	By my heel I care not.
L472400	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	By my head here come the Capulets.
L472399	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
L472398	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Am I like Such a fellow?
L472397	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need.
L472356	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	The what?
L472355	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song keeps time distance and proportion; he rests his minim rest one two and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
L472354	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Why what is Tybalt?
L472353	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
L472352	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Nay he will answer the letter's master how he dares being dared.
L472351	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
L472350	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it?
L472349	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	A challenge on my life.
L472348	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
L472347	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Why that pale hard-hearted wench that Rosaline. Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
L472346	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
L472345	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
L472285	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes By her high forehead and her scarlet lip By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh! O Romeo that she were An open ass and thou a poperin pear! Romeo good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
L472284	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Romeo! Romeo!
L472420	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Art thou hurt?
L472419	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Forbear this outrage good Mercutio.
L472250	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I fear too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He that hath the steerage of my course Direct my sail! On lusty gentlemen.
L472249	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves; Supper is done and we shall come too late.
L472239	u7307	m493	ROMEO	But 'tis no wit to go.
L472238	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Every man betake him to his legs.
L472209	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Not mad but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison kept without my food Whipp'd and tormented. Good day good fellow.
L472208	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why Romeo art thou mad?
L472207	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Teach me how I should forget to think.
L472206	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me forget to think of her.
L472205	u7307	m493	ROMEO	She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste.
L472204	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
L472203	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
L472202	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	A right fair mark fair cuz is soonest hit.
L472201	u7307	m493	ROMEO	A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
L472200	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.
L472199	u7307	m493	ROMEO	In sadness cousin I do love a woman.
L472198	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness who is that you love.
L472192	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so you do me wrong.
L472191	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Farewell my cuz.
L472190	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
L472189	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Good heart at what?
L472188	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	No cuz I rather weep.
L472187	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Alas that love whose view is muffled still Should without eyes see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate but more with love. Why then O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
L472186	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Alas that love so gentle in his view Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
L472185	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Out of her favour where I am in love.
L472184	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Of love?
L472183	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Out--
L472182	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	In love?
L472181	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Not having that which having makes them short.
L472180	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
L472179	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
L472178	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	But new struck cuz.
L472177	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Is the day so young?
L472176	u7298	m493	BENVOLIO	Good-morrow cousin.
L472175	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Why then O brawling love O loving hate O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
L472265	u7299	m493	CAPULET	Go to! What goodman boy! I say he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
L472264	u7309	m493	TYBALT	Uncle 'tis a shame.
L472263	u7299	m493	CAPULET	He shall be endured
L472262	u7309	m493	TYBALT	I'll not endure him.
L472261	u7299	m493	CAPULET	Content thee gentle cuz content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient take no note of him
L472260	u7309	m493	TYBALT	'Tis he.
L472259	u7299	m493	CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?
L472258	u7309	m493	TYBALT	Uncle this is that villain Romeo a Montague our foe.
L472257	u7299	m493	CAPULET	Why how now kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
L472256	u7309	m493	TYBALT	What dares the slave Come hither To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now by the stock and honour of my kin To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
L472541	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
L472540	u7300	m493	CRUSTY	Drink it off and if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
L472539	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
L472538	u7300	m493	CRUSTY	My poverty but not my will consents.
L472537	u7307	m493	ROMEO	The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law. Then be not poor but break it and take this.
L472536	u7300	m493	CRUSTY	Such mortal drugs I have but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
L472519	u7303	m493	JULIET	What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
L472518	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	I do spy a kind of hope Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If rather than to marry Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame. No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime against thou shalt awake shall Romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
L472517	u7303	m493	JULIET	Be not so long to speak I long to die.
L472516	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Hold Daughter!
L472515	u7303	m493	JULIET	If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise And with this I'll help it presently!
L472514	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	It strains me past the compass of my wits.
L472511	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	My leisure serves me pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
L472510	u7303	m493	JULIET	Are you at leisure Holy Father now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
L472527	u7307	m493	ROMEO	And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
L472526	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	As the custom is in all her best array bear her to church.
L472457	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Farewell.

But look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
L472455	u7307	m493	ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this.
L472444	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
L472443	u7307	m493	ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
L472442	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Affliction is enamoured of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient for the world is broad and wide.
L472441	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Banishment? Be merciful say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
L472344	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
L472343	u7307	m493	ROMEO	O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
L472342	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	O she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come young waverer come go with me In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove to turn you household rachor to pure love.
L472341	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I pray thee chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
L472340	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	For doting; not for loving pupil mine.
L472339	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
L472338	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Holy Saint Francis what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
L472337	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met we wooed we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray that thou consent to marry us today.
L472336	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Be plain good son and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
L472335	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I have been feasting with mine enemy where on a sudden one hath wounded me that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
L472334	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been
L472333	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name and that name's woe.
L472332	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	God pardon sin was thou with Rosaline!?
L472331	u7307	m493	ROMEO	The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
L472330	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Young son it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so then here I hit it right our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
L472327	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
L472326	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Good marrow father!
L472454	u7306	m493	NURSE	Sir a ring my lady bid me give you.
L472453	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
L472448	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Romeo come forth.

L472446	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	Welcome.
L472445	u7306	m493	NURSE	I come for my lady Juliet.
L472325	u7301	m493	FATHER LAWRENCE	O mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this being smelt with that part cheers each part; being tasted slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
L472324	u7306	m493	NURSE	Juliet!

L472216	u7306	m493	NURSE	I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
L472551	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
L472550	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
L472478	u7303	m493	JULIET	O God I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune fortune. Be fickle fortune for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
L472477	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I doubt it not. Trust me love all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
L472476	u7303	m493	JULIET	Then window let day in and let life out. O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
L472473	u7307	m493	ROMEO	More Light and light more dark and dark our woes.
L472472	u7303	m493	JULIET	It is It is! Hie hence be gone away.  O now be gone. More light and light it grows.
L472471	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Let me be taken let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death Welcome Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
L472470	u7303	m493	JULIET	That light is not daylight I know it I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
L472469	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I must be gone and live or stay and die.
L472468	u7303	m493	JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
L472428	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
L472427	u7303	m493	JULIET	Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though I am sold not yet enjoyed. O tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
L472322	u7303	m493	JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
L472321	u7307	m493	ROMEO	By the hour of nine.
L472320	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
L472319	u7307	m493	ROMEO	A thousand times the worse to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love toward school with heavy looks.
L472318	u7303	m493	JULIET	A thousand times good night! Exit above
L472317	u7307	m493	ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
L472310	u7303	m493	JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
L472309	u7307	m493	ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
L472308	u7303	m493	JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
L472307	u7307	m493	ROMEO	O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
L472306	u7303	m493	JULIET	Do not swear: although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash too unadvised too sudden; Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet good night! This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
L472305	u7307	m493	ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
L472304	u7303	m493	JULIET	Do not swear at all; Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And I'll believe thee.
L472303	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well what shall I swear by?
L472302	u7303	m493	JULIET	O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon That monthly changes in her circled orb Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
L472301	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
L472300	u7303	m493	JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully:
L472299	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes And but thou love me let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love.
L472298	u7303	m493	JULIET	If they do see thee they will murder thee.
L472297	u7307	m493	ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
L472296	u7303	m493	JULIET	How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
L472295	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Neither fair maid if either thee dislike.
L472294	u7303	m493	JULIET	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
L472293	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ahhh!
L472292	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I take thee at thy word.
L472291	u7303	m493	JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo doff thy name And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
L472290	u7307	m493	ROMEO	[Aside] Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this?
L472289	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
L472288	u7307	m493	ROMEO	She speaks: O speak again bright angel!
L472287	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ay me!
L472286	u7307	m493	ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady O it is my love! O that she knew she were!
L472276	u7303	m493	JULIET	You kiss by the book.
L472275	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
L472274	u7303	m493	JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
L472273	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged.
L472272	u7303	m493	JULIET	Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake.
L472271	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well then dear saint let lips do what hands do; They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair.
L472270	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer.
L472269	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Have not saints lips and holy palmers too?
L472268	u7303	m493	JULIET	Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
L472267	u7307	m493	ROMEO	If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine the gentle sin is this: My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
L472266	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Did my heart love till now? forswear it sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
L472230	u7306	m493	NURSE	Go girl seek happy nights to happy days.
L472229	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	Go! We follow thee. Juliet Blah!
L472226	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly can you like of Paris' love?
L472225	u7306	m493	NURSE	Nay bigger; women grow by men.
L472224	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love this unbound lover To beautify him only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess By having him making yourself no less.
L472223	u7306	m493	NURSE	Nay he's a flower; in faith a very flower.
L472222	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
L472221	u7306	m493	NURSE	A man young lady! Lady such a man As all the world- -why he's a man of wax.
L472220	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	By my count I was your mother much upon these years You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
L472219	u7306	m493	NURSE	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
L472218	u7304	m493	LADY CAPULET	Nurse give leave awhile We must talk in secret. Nurse come back again; I have remember'd me thou's hear our counsel. Nurse Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
L472426	u7307	m493	ROMEO	NO! Mercutio!
L472425	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	A Plague o' both your houses.
L472424	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
L472423	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
L472422	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Courage man the hurt can not be much.
L472421	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Ay ay a scratch a scratch. Ay a scratch a scratch. HA HA HA.
L472376	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Farewell ancient lady; farewell
L472375	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I will follow you.
L472372	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
L472371	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art by art as well as by nature.
L472370	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Why then is my pump well flowered.
L472369	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Right.
L472368	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Pink for flower.
L472367	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.
L472366	u7307	m493	ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
L472365	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
L472364	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Meaning to court'sy.
L472363	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
L472362	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Pardon good Mercutio my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
L472361	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	The slip son the slip; can you not conceive?
L472360	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
L472359	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Signior Romeo bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
L472358	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Ho Ho Capital Punks!
L472281	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Ay so I fear; the more is my unrest.
L472280	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Away begone; the sport is at the best.
L472248	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	True I talk of dreams Which are the children of an idle brain Begot of nothing but vain fantasy Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north And being anger'd puffs away from thence Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
L472247	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Peace good Mercutio peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
L472246	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers who straight dream on fees Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag when maids lie on their backs That presses them and learns them first to bear Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
L472245	u7307	m493	ROMEO	In bed asleep while they do dream things true.
L472244	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
L472243	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well what was yours?
L472242	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	And so did I.
L472241	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.
L472240	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Why may one ask?
L472237	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you be rough with love; Prick love for pricking and you beat love down.
L472236	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? It is too rough Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn.
L472235	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
L472234	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
L472233	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound.
L472232	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Not I Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
L472231	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Young hearts run free. Never be caught up caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance.
L472418	u7309	m493	TYBALT	I am for you.
L472417	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Good king of cat's nothing but one of your nine lives.
L472416	u7309	m493	TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?
L472415	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Calm Dishonorable Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher will you walk?
L472407	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds Consort!
L472406	u7309	m493	TYBALT	Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
L472405	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
L472404	u7309	m493	TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that sir. And you will give me occasion.
L472403	u7305	m493	MERCUTIO	OH and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
L472402	u7309	m493	TYBALT	Follow me close. Gentlemen gooday. A word with one of you?
L472452	u7307	m493	ROMEO	As if that name Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
L472451	u7306	m493	NURSE	O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
L472450	u7306	m493	NURSE	Sir. Ah sir. Death the end of all
L472449	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Nurse.
L472378	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
L472377	u7306	m493	NURSE	If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise as they say it were a very gross kind of behavior as they say: for the lady is young; and therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an ill thing and very weak dealing.
L472279	u7306	m493	NURSE	His name is Romeo and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
L472278	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
L472277	u7306	m493	NURSE	Madam your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
