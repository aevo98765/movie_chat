L472311	u7306	m493	NURSE	Juliet!
L472217	u7303	m493	JULIET	Madam I am here. What is your will?
L472216	u7306	m493	NURSE	I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
L472551	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
L472550	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
L472478	u7303	m493	JULIET	O God I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee now thou art so low as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune fortune. Be fickle fortune for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
L472477	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I doubt it not. Trust me love all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
L472476	u7303	m493	JULIET	Then window let day in and let life out. O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
L472473	u7307	m493	ROMEO	More Light and light more dark and dark our woes.
L472472	u7303	m493	JULIET	It is It is! Hie hence be gone away.  O now be gone. More light and light it grows.
L472471	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Let me be taken let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death Welcome Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
L472470	u7303	m493	JULIET	That light is not daylight I know it I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
L472469	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I must be gone and live or stay and die.
L472468	u7303	m493	JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
L472428	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
L472427	u7303	m493	JULIET	Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die take him and cut him out into little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed and though I am sold not yet enjoyed. O tedious is this day as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
L472322	u7303	m493	JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
L472321	u7307	m493	ROMEO	By the hour of nine.
L472320	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
L472319	u7307	m493	ROMEO	A thousand times the worse to want thy light. Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books But love from love toward school with heavy looks.
L472318	u7303	m493	JULIET	A thousand times good night! Exit above
L472317	u7307	m493	ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
L472310	u7303	m493	JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
L472309	u7307	m493	ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
L472308	u7303	m493	JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
L472307	u7307	m493	ROMEO	O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
L472306	u7303	m493	JULIET	Do not swear: although I joy in thee I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash too unadvised too sudden; Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet good night! This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
L472305	u7307	m493	ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
L472304	u7303	m493	JULIET	Do not swear at all; Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self Which is the god of my idolatry And I'll believe thee.
L472303	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well what shall I swear by?
L472302	u7303	m493	JULIET	O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon That monthly changes in her circled orb Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
L472301	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
L472300	u7303	m493	JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully:
L472299	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes And but thou love me let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued wanting of thy love.
L472298	u7303	m493	JULIET	If they do see thee they will murder thee.
L472297	u7307	m493	ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
L472296	u7303	m493	JULIET	How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb And the place death considering who thou art If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
L472295	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Neither fair maid if either thee dislike.
L472294	u7303	m493	JULIET	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
L472293	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ahhh!
L472292	u7307	m493	ROMEO	I take thee at thy word.
L472291	u7303	m493	JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would were he not Romeo call'd Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo doff thy name And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
L472290	u7307	m493	ROMEO	[Aside] Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this?
L472289	u7303	m493	JULIET	Romeo O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
L472288	u7307	m493	ROMEO	She speaks: O speak again bright angel!
L472287	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ay me!
L472286	u7307	m493	ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady O it is my love! O that she knew she were!
L472276	u7303	m493	JULIET	You kiss by the book.
L472275	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
L472274	u7303	m493	JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
L472273	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged.
L472272	u7303	m493	JULIET	Saints do not move though grant for prayers' sake.
L472271	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Well then dear saint let lips do what hands do; They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair.
L472270	u7303	m493	JULIET	Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer.
L472269	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Have not saints lips and holy palmers too?
L472268	u7303	m493	JULIET	Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
L472267	u7307	m493	ROMEO	If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine the gentle sin is this: My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
L472266	u7307	m493	ROMEO	Did my heart love till now? forswear it sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
L472230	u7306	m493	NURSE	Go girl seek happy nights to happy days.
