L165610	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
L165548	u4841	m323	BIG JOHNSON	If he's not a terrorist and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
L165547	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	No sir.
L165546	u4841	m323	BIG JOHNSON	One of yours?
L165530	u4841	m323	BIG JOHNSON	Not any more.
L165529	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
L165528	u4841	m323	BIG JOHNSON	I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
L165448	u4842	m323	ELLIS	Hey I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
L165447	u4844	m323	HOLLY	What are you going to do?
L165446	u4842	m323	ELLIS	I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
L165445	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Where are you going?
L165242	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
L165241	u4842	m323	ELLIS	His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
L165240	u4844	m323	HOLLY	How about his job?
L165239	u4842	m323	ELLIS	John?  Christ he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
L165238	u4844	m323	HOLLY	John.
L165237	u4842	m323	ELLIS	The police...?
L165236	u4844	m323	HOLLY	They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
L165235	u4842	m323	ELLIS	What's happening?
L165487	u4842	m323	ELLIS	John how can you say that after all these years--?  John?  John?
L165486	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis for Christ's sake tell him you don't mean shit to me --
L165485	u4842	m323	ELLIS	What am I a method actor?  Hans babe put away the gun.  This is radio not television...
L165483	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans listen to me that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are but I do --
L165482	u4842	m323	ELLIS	John I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
L165478	u4842	m323	ELLIS	Tell me about it.
L165477	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
L165476	u4842	m323	ELLIS	I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
L165475	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Ellis what have you told them?
L165474	u4842	m323	ELLIS	John they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job and I can appreciate that but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
L165460	u4842	m323	ELLIS	The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
L165459	u4843	m323	HANS	I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
L165458	u4842	m323	ELLIS	Hey business is business.  You use a gun I use a fountain pen what's the difference?  To put it in my terms you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans baby...I'm your white knight.
L165457	u4843	m323	HANS	You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
L165456	u4842	m323	ELLIS	Hey I read the papers I watch 60 minutes I say to myself these guys are professionals they're motivated they're happening. They want something.  Now personally I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys maybe it's the Hebes Northern Ireland that's none of my business.  I figure You're here to negotiate am I right?
L165455	u4843	m323	HANS	You're very perceptive.
L165453	u4843	m323	HANS	What does he want?
L165452	u4842	m323	ELLIS	Hope I'm not interrupting...?
L165505	u4843	m323	HANS	I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
L165504	u4845	m323	KARL	'Asian Dawn Movement?'
L165451	u4845	m323	KARL	I don't want neutral...I want dead --
L165450	u4843	m323	HANS	If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
L165449	u4845	m323	KARL	-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
L165325	u4843	m323	HANS	He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
L165324	u4845	m323	KARL	He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
L165267	u4843	m323	HANS	Karl I know you want him but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
L165266	u4845	m323	KARL	Hans he killed by brother --
L165234	u4845	m323	KARL	And if he alters it...?						*
L165233	u4843	m323	HANS	No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
L165232	u4845	m323	KARL	He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
L165231	u4843	m323	HANS	I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
L165202	u4843	m323	HANS	See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
L165201	u4845	m323	KARL	Nothing...
L165199	u4843	m323	HANS	Okay.
L165198	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
L165193	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
L165192	u4843	m323	HANS	The code key please...?
L165191	u4843	m323	HANS	Who said we were terrorists?
L165190	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
L165189	u4843	m323	HANS	Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
L165182	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
L165181	u4843	m323	HANS	It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
L165689	u4843	m323	HANS	'Yippe-ki-yea mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
L165688	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Whoa Hans now you're the cowboy?
L165687	u4843	m323	HANS	No more jokes drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
L165686	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	That was Gary Cooper shithead...
L165685	u4843	m323	HANS	Nein dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
L165568	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
L165567	u4843	m323	HANS	I'm going to count to three...
L165566	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	That was tricky with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators Hans? I already used the explosives.
L165565	u4843	m323	HANS	Put it down now.
L165564	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Hans.  Your Hans.
L165561	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Sounds better than nothing.
L165560	u4843	m323	HANS	One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know that game with the the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
L165559	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Bill you know how to use a handgun?
L165558	u4843	m323	HANS	William Clay.  Call me Bill.
L165557	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Better than being caught with your pants down right?  John McClane.
L165556	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
L165555	u4843	m323	HANS	New York...
L165554	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I'm a cop from New York.
L165553	u4843	m323	HANS	You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
L165537	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Only if New Jersey counts.
L165536	u4843	m323	HANS	You...you're an American?
L165533	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Whoa whoa easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
L165532	u4843	m323	HANS	--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them I know it --
L165489	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Go fuck yourself.
L165488	u4843	m323	HANS	Hear that?  Talk to me where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
L165322	u4843	m323	HANS	Do you really think you have a chance against us Mr. Cowboy?
L165321	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Actually I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
L165320	u4843	m323	HANS	I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
L165319	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I wouldn't think of leaving Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
L165318	u4843	m323	HANS	Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
L165316	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Just the fly in the ointment Hans. The monkey in the wrench the pain in the ass -
L165315	u4843	m323	HANS	Who are you then?
L165314	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Bad for your health anyway.
L165607	u4850	m323	THEO	The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
L165606	u4843	m323	HANS	Encourage them to be bolder.
L165599	u4850	m323	THEO	When you're hot you're hot.
L165598	u4843	m323	HANS	...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles Theo...I give you the FBI...
L165581	u4843	m323	HANS	* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
L165580	u4850	m323	THEO	You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
L165329	u4843	m323	HANS	Then don't waste time talking to me.
L165328	u4850	m323	THEO	Three down four to go --
L165327	u4843	m323	HANS	We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
L165326	u4850	m323	THEO	Yo!
L165209	u4843	m323	HANS	If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
L165208	u4850	m323	THEO	Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
L165207	u4843	m323	HANS	How long?
L165195	u4850	m323	THEO	I told you...
L165194	u4843	m323	HANS	Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
L165658	u4843	m323	HANS	I'm an exceptional thief Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping you should be more polite.
L165657	u4844	m323	HOLLY	After all your posturing all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
L165369	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
L165368	u4843	m323	HANS	Mr. Takagi chose his people well Mrs...?
L165367	u4843	m323	HANS	Yes you're right.  It will be done.
L165366	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Good enough.  And unless you like is messy you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
L165365	u4843	m323	HANS	No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
L165364	u4844	m323	HOLLY	We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax she's not due for two weeks but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
L165363	u4843	m323	HANS	Go on.
L165362	u4844	m323	HOLLY	You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
L165361	u4843	m323	HANS	Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
L165360	u4844	m323	HOLLY	I...have a request.
L165683	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Holly we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building Hans?
L165682	u4844	m323	HOLLY	John!
L165158	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Don't I always?
L165157	u4844	m323	HOLLY	I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
L165153	u4844	m323	HOLLY	You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up well hell a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that John.  I deserved that.
L165152	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Oh here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
L165151	u4844	m323	HOLLY	My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
L165150	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
L165149	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it John there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
L165148	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean talk about your wind chill factor...
L165147	u4844	m323	HOLLY	This is a Japanese company you know? They figure a married woman she's on the way out the door...
L165146	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
L165145	u4844	m323	HOLLY	...I've missed you.						*
L165144	u4844	m323	HOLLY	I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
L165143	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	They would huh?
L165142	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge but the kids would love to have you at the house.
L165141	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Ramona...no Pomona that's it.
L165140	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Oh...Where does he live?
L165139	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Well Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
L165137	u4844	m323	HOLLY	That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
L165136	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	It's a long story.  You know I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
L165135	u4844	m323	HOLLY	What are you doing?
L165133	u4844	m323	HOLLY	Sure.  Follow me.
L165132	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Nice but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
L165129	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah.  I remember our first date.
L165128	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
L165123	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	Hey we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out we got you with tape decks.
L165122	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
L165121	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
L165120	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Relax Ellis.  I'm off duty.
L165115	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	So I've heard.
L165114	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	I've spent half my life on airplanes			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
L165113	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah.  How'd you know?
L165112	u4849	m323	TAKAGI	Holly Gennero?
L165111	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Excuse me I'm looking for --
L165697	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I'm serious.  Hey this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
L165696	u4847	m323	POWELL	Bullshit.
L165695	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Al.  Man you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
L165630	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Stand by Powell.  I gotta check something out.
L165629	u4847	m323	POWELL	Roy?
L165628	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans you bastard...what were you doing?
L165627	u4847	m323	POWELL	I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
L165626	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
L165603	u4847	m323	POWELL	Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it step by step.
L165602	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Powell?  What's going on?
L165595	u4847	m323	POWELL	Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
L165594	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I still feel like shit.
L165593	u4847	m323	POWELL	Hey you couldn't know.
L165592	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
L165591	u4847	m323	POWELL	Eleven years ago.  Oh it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
L165590	u4847	m323	POWELL	I...I shot a kid.
L165589	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	They way you drive I can see why.
L165586	u4847	m323	POWELL	You don't want to know.
L165585	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah?  What's the odds?
L165584	u4847	m323	POWELL	They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
L165583	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah.  But all things being equal I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way chalk up two more terrorists.
L165582	u4847	m323	POWELL	Roy?  You still with us?
L165518	u4847	m323	POWELL	In my youth partner.  In my youth.
L165517	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	The way you drove that car I figured you for the streets.
L165516	u4847	m323	POWELL	Don't tell me partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
L165515	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Speaking of cows did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
L165514	u4847	m323	POWELL	I'm here cowboy.
L165513	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Al?  Al you there?
L165467	u4847	m323	POWELL	It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
L165466	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
L165465	u4847	m323	POWELL	Not yet the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
L165464	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
L165463	u4847	m323	POWELL	'Sugar enriched flour partially hydrogenated vegetable oil polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
L165462	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Yeah just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
L165441	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Thanks...partner.
L165440	u4847	m323	POWELL	Hey I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there man.  Hang in there.
L165428	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Two?  Are you sure?
L165427	u4847	m323	POWELL	No but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
L165426	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
L165425	u4847	m323	POWELL	Safe and sound thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
L165389	u4847	m323	POWELL	I said we'll talk later Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen when to shut up... and when to pray.
L165388	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	Al what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh God.  You're coming in!  That's it isn't it?  Christ Powell I told you what you're dealing with here --
L165387	u4847	m323	POWELL	I'm here Roy but I'm uh kind of busy.  Let's talk later okay?
L165346	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	They're all yours Al.  Good luck.
L165345	u4847	m323	POWELL	Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know don't be shy okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
L165344	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	'Roy'.
L165343	u4847	m323	POWELL	Uh what do I call you?
L165342	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I'm ahead of you...partner.
L165341	u4847	m323	POWELL	I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it so light 'em if you got 'em.
L165340	u4846	m323	MCCLANE	I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
L165339	u4847	m323	POWELL	How do you know?
L165498	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
L165497	u4847	m323	POWELL	This is --
L165494	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Anytime you want to go home Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
L165493	u4847	m323	POWELL	He's alone tired hunted and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
L165492	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
L165491	u4847	m323	POWELL	Christ can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
L165490	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Goddamn didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
L165431	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Give me that.  Now listen to me mister I don't know what you think you're doing but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
L165430	u4847	m323	POWELL	Yessir.
L165429	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Is that him?
L165380	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
L165379	u4847	m323	POWELL	What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
L165378	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	-- all we know?  We don't know shit Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
L165377	u4847	m323	POWELL	Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
L165376	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	What's it look like?  We're going in.
L165375	u4847	m323	POWELL	What's going on?
L165358	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ Powell he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
L165357	u4847	m323	POWELL	A hunch.  Things he said.  Like knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
L165356	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	How do you know?
L165355	u4847	m323	POWELL	I don't think so Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD but definitely a badge.
L165354	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	He claims?  Powell has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
L165353	u4847	m323	POWELL	We don't exactly know Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
L165352	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Then who the hell have you been talking too?
L165351	u4847	m323	POWELL	The terrorists?  Don't know Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
L165350	u4848	m323	ROBINSON	Dwayne Robinson.  Well what have you learned?  What do they want?
L165349	u4847	m323	POWELL	I am Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
